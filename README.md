## Body Mass Index (BMI)

**BMI** (Body Mass Index) is a measurement used to assess a person's body composition based on their height and weight. It helps quantify tissue mass and is commonly used as a general indicator of whether an individual has a healthy body weight for their height.

### How BMI Works:
The value obtained from the BMI calculation is used to classify individuals into categories:
- **Underweight**
- **Normal weight**
- **Overweight**
- **Obese**

These categories are determined by the range the BMI value falls within, helping to provide an overall picture of a person's health in relation to their weight.
